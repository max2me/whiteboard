# Napkin
Inspired by the book [Unfolding the Napkin](https://www.amazon.com/Unfolding-Napkin-Hands-Problems-Pictures/dp/1591843197), this is an design experiment to create a collaborative sketching experience that is simple yet fluid and flexible. I use it mostly when trying to illustrate my point in Skype or phone conversations with remote peers.

## Important Notices
* Touch support is very rudminetary and still a bit buggy.
* All drawings are stored in memory. If instance goes down, so do all the napkins with whatever was sketched on them.
